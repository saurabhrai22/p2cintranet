    <h4>Fast Track</h4>
    <p>A pilot project has been initiated with few markets, any requirement from HQ or LC that falls under fast track category as per the “Fast Track Request” document can be raised under this category. Tickets raised under this category
      <b> will be included in the monthly ticket count</b>.</p>
    <h4>Query</h4>
    <p> Any request to check the feasibility of the requirement or research for workable solution for the client would fall in this category. Tickets raised under this category <b> will not be included in the monthly ticket count</b>.
      Any development activity required as a result of the output of Query ticket will not be done on the same ticket. A new ticket under task or fast track should be raised and the ticket rules should be followed.</p>

      <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="/img/tools/jira_rules/ticket-rules1.png"><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/tools/jira_rules/ticket-rules1.png"></a>

      <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="/img/jira_rules/ticket-rules2.png"><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/tools/jira_rules/ticket-rules2.png"></a><br>
    </ul>
      Ticket rules for each category/sub category of request are as follows –
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Banner Category - </strong>Each banner counts as 1 ticket. This ticket will include the creation of banner (flash/HTML) + fallback images (static). Additional sub task will not be created for fall back images. All
          requests raised under banner category Local account leads would create 1 main task for Banner adaptation request for each Brand/market/Language/Platform. IDC team would be responsible for the calculation of banner format
          required and for each banner format 1 sub task would be created.
          <br>The sub categories that follow this rule are - Banners - Adaptation from Master, Dynamic Banner - first set up of a campaign, Banners - Minor Changes/Modification and Banners - Resizing/Reformatting
          <br><strong>For Ex</strong> – If a request is raised for BE-FR to adapt banner having 3 formats mainly 300x600, 970x250 and 160x600, then LAL’s are required to raise 1 ticket and IDC would create 2 sub tasks to this sub
          category.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics Sub category – </strong> LAL’s are requested to raise 1 ticket for each Brand/market/Platform for up to 50 URL’s. IDC would go ahead and create 1 sub task from 51st URL for the next 50 set of URL’s.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics Tags Bugs –</strong> This category would be only used by the analytics team to report the bugs generated during analytics testing. This sub category should not be used LAL. Tickets raised under this sub
          category will be excluded from the monthly ticket count.</li>
        <li><strong>Call to Action/Broken Links Sub category –</strong> All LAL’s are requested to raise 1 ticket for each Brand/market/language/Platform up to 10 URL’s. IDC would go ahead and create 1 sub task from 11th URL for the
          next 50 set of tickets.</li>
        <li><strong>Feature/Functionality –</strong> 1 ticket for the implementation of a new functionality which has not been implemented previously or not present on any other websites. </li>
        <li><strong>Images –</strong> For this sub category, when the graphics team is involved 6 images would be accommodates per ticket LAL’s are requested to raise 1 ticket for up to 6 images. IDC would go ahead and create 1 sub
          task from 6th image for the next 6 set of images. If the only activity is to upload the images given by HQ/LC on the CMS where graphics team is not involved 25 images would be accommodated in 1 ticket. <br>
          <strong>For Ex –</strong> If there is request raised by LAL to work on images for sliders which require Graphics Producers to work and finalize the images, IDC would go ahead and create a sub task for Graphics team to work
          on. Each of these sub task would accommodate 6 images, once the images are ready content team would go ahead and upload the image in CMS. On the other hand, there are times when HQ/LC has given the final images and content
          team is required to upload the images in CMS. Under such circumstances, 25 images would be accommodated in 1 ticket</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple Content –</strong> For requests under this sub category LAL are required to create 1 main ticket for each Brand/market/language/Platform and requirements should be attached as PPT. IDC would go ahead and
          check the number of slides per PPT and accommodate up to 25 changes on each ticket. From the 26st change, IDC would go ahead and create a sub task for the next 25 set of changes.
          <br><br><strong>NOTE: A change can be changing 1 whole paragraph or changing 1 line or changing 1 single word or changing 1 single character (e.g. removing a semi colon)
    <br>For Ex – If a monolingual market attaches a PPT having 65 changes in a single ticket, IDC would go ahead and create 3 subtasks. First 25 changes would be marked to the main ticket. For the next 25 changes IDC, would create 1 subtask, following 15 changes would be worked on in the 2nd sub task. If within these slides, graphical changes are required and IDC needs to involve the graphics team, 1 sub task would be created for graphics activity. The slides requiring graphical changes would be excluded from the content count and included in graphics counts. For Graphical work, 1 ticket would accommodate 6 image changes.</strong>
          <br><br>For Bilingual and trilingual markets, LAL’s should create a ticket for every language within the market. The number of slides on slides for a language would be calculate and the same logic would follow.
          <br><br><strong>For Ex – If a trilingual market attaches a single PPT have 65 changes in a single ticket. IDC checks the number of slider corresponding to the 3 languages of the market.  Language 1 has 20 changes, language 2 has 20 changes and language 3 had 25 changes, then the ticket below to the 3rd language would have 1 subtask. The tickets for language 1 and language 2 would not have any subtasks. If within these slides, graphical changes are required and IDC needs to involve the graphics team, 1 sub task would be created for graphics activity. The slides requiring graphical changes would be excluded from the count and included in graphics counts. For Graphical work, 1 ticket would accommodate 6 image changes.</strong></li>

      <h4 class="primary-color" id="Change_Management">4. Change Management</h4>
      <p> An editorial change request in the Jira ticketing system happens when the customer requests variations to the initial brief attached to the Jira ticket when opened. JIRA Ticket rule for Change management would be the same for all
        stages of the ticket.</p>
      <h4>Banner Category</h4>
      <p>For all sub categories under this category, ticketing rules would remain the same for change request. When a market requests for alteration or changes within the scope of requests, LAL is expected to attach an updated PPT on the
        JIRA ticket. IDC will consider the total development activity required within the life span of the ticket and 1 sub task for 12 banner formats
        <br><strong>For Ex –</strong> If a market creates a ticket having 20 banner formats. IDC team would analyze the request and create 19 sub tasks + 1 main ticket = 20 ticket for the 20 banner formats requested in the ticket. Now, while
        the ticket is still in progress if LC decides to change the price/legal text to be displayed on the banners. IDC would now have to change the price/legal text on all the 20 banner formats. In such circumstances, IDC would go ahead
        and create 2 sub task for this change request. 1st sub task would accommodate 12 banners and the 2nd sub task would accommodate 8 banners Every time a new change is requested by the market, a new sub task would be created. </p>
      <h4>Content Editorial Category</h4>
      <p>For all sub categories under Content Editorial categories, the ticket rule would remain same for change request. When a market requests for alteration or changes within the scope of requests, LAL is expected to attach an updated PPT
        on the JIRA ticket. IDC will consider the overall development activity required within the ticket at various stages and based on the sub category create appropriate number of sub tasks.
        <br><strong>For Ex –</strong> If market has raised a request under “multiple changes” sub category for content editorial activity with 65 changes in a PPT, IDC would create 3 subtasks. Main ticket would consider 25 changes, 1st sub
        task would account slides 26-50, 2nd sub task would account for slides 51-65. While the ticket is in QC, if market adds on an updated PPT of 15 changes, IDC would accommodate the first 10 changes in the 2rd sub task (since the
        bandwidth for multiple content changes is 25 changes) and create a 3rd sub task for the remaining 5 changes. While waiting for approval on these 80 (65 first request + 15 change request) changes, if client request for some changes,
        LAL is expected to add the new PPT on the ticket. IDC will consider the number of changes on the new PPT and create 1 new sub task if the number of changes is within 25 changes.<strong> If within these slides, graphical changes are required and IDC needs to involve the graphics team, 1 sub task would be created for graphics activity. The slides requiring graphical changes would be excluded from the count and included in graphics counts. For Graphical work, 1 ticket would accommodate 6 image changes as mentioned in the Change Management rule for Banner Category.
