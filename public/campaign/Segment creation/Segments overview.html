        <h4 class="primary-color" id="chi_siamo_page">Segments Overview</h4>
        <p>Segments are groups of contacts generated based on filter criteria and contact lists. Segments can filter
            contacts
            based on criteria like if they own a particular brand, whether or not they requested for a newsletter,
            whether or not
            expressed their interest to buy a car or whether or not they opened/clicked the previous email sent.</p>
        <p>Segments are used to feed email distribution in campaigns. They allow you to specify which contacts are
            included,
            and then to customize the subsequent actions for those contacts.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4><b>Examples</b></h4>
        <p>Segments can be very general, like people who have given permission to send newsletters, belong to
            a particular group (Jeep Owner’s Group), registered on a particular date or belong to particular gender
            etc.
            Create segments that are appropriate for your client’s needs.</p>
        <br>

        <p><b>Note: All the below steps of Segment creation and Campaign creation is with the
                assumption that the user has Campaign Manager access.</b></p>
