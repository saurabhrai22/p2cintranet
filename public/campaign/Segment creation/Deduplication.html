        <h4 class="primary-color" id="chi_siamo_page">Deduplication</h4>
        <p>Deduplication rules are rules that let you check data entities (contacts and/or accounts) to ensure that
            there are not duplicate records
            in the database. You can create a deduplication rule that uses multiple fields, partial matches, and
            phonetic matches to identify contacts
            or accounts that are duplicated.</p><br>

        <p>Deduplication process ensures that a single contact is not present in more than one segment.
            This avoids targeting the same contact multiple times for the same campaign with the same newsletter.</p>
        <br>

        <p><b>Important Rule: Deduplication process is performed only when the count in atleast one segment is more
                than 1k.</b></p>
        <br>

        <p>Deduplication is the final step in the segment and campaign creation process. Kindly below the steps to
            perform Deduplication.</p>

        <ol>
            <li> Find the segment created previously&gt;rename and add “_01” at the end (“_01” is the deduplication
                order, the next segment if
                any will have “_02” and so on. </li>
            <br>
            <div>
                <!-- <img src="../img/image1.png class="img-responsive img-rounded zoom shadow-box">-->
                <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="/img/campaign/image6.1.1.png"><img src="/img/campaign/image6.1.1.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded"></a>
            </div>
            <br>


            <li> The name changed will automatically appear in the campaign. Please add “_01” to the step name as well.</li>
            <br>
            <div>
                <!-- <img src="/img/campaign/image1.png class="img-responsive img-rounded zoom shadow-box">-->
                <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="/img/campaign/image6.2.2.png"><img src="/img/campaign/image6.2.2.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded"></a>
            </div>
            <br>

            <li> The final and most important step of deduplication is to add “_DD” at the end of campaign name.
                Without this the deduplication process won’t start.<br>
                <br>
                <div>

                </div>
                <br>
                <p>Kindly close the campaign once all the above changes has been done. And please the counts on the
                    ticket once the deduplication is completed.</p>

                        <li> Deduplication process starts after every 2 hours.</li>
