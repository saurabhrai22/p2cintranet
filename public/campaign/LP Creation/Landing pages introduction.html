		<h4 class="primary-color" id="chi_siamo_page">Landing Pages Introduction</h4>

		<p>Landing Pages are microsites which are used to gather information of users. Conventionally we had 2 types of
			landing pages i.e. Desktop &amp; mobile however now for major markets we have a single page which is device response
			however there are still some pages which have a separate desktop and mobile page. </p>
		<p>Each Landing page has a form which has fields to gather basic information of the user like First Name, Last Name,
			Email, Address, Phone, Postal codeâ€¦.etc. There are other set of information gathered for e.g. if the user already
			has a car &amp; would like to exchange it. There are 3 pages associated to the Landing page process. </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Landing page with form to gather the information</li><br>
			<div>
				<!-- <img src="../img/image1.png class="img-responsive img-rounded zoom shadow-box">-->
				<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="/img/campaign/lp1.png"><img src="/img/campaign/lp1.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded"></a>
			</div><br>

			<li>Dealer Page to select the dealer nearest to user
				Note: Few markets choose to have a dealer selection in the landing page form , hence the dealer page is not present
				in such cases and user is sent directly to thank you page.
			</li><br>
			<div>
				<!-- <img src="/img/campaign/image1.png class="img-responsive img-rounded zoom shadow-box">-->
				<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="/img/campaign/lp2.png"><img src="/img/campaign/lp2.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded"></a>
			</div><br>

			<li>Thank you page </li><br>
			<div>
				<!-- <img src="/img/campaign/image1.png class="img-responsive img-rounded zoom shadow-box">-->
				<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="/img/campaign/lp3.png"><img src="/img/campaign/lp3.png" class="img-responsive img-rounded"></a>
			</div>

			<strong>Note:</strong> Since each brand has multiple models the landing page would be created individually for each
			model (1 for desktop &amp; 1 for mobile or a single responsive page ). However the dealer page &amp; the thank you
			page would be created 1 per brand which means that there will be 1 page per brand &amp; not per model as the case
			for landing page. Also please note that he dealer selection option is embedded in the landing page for mobile hence
			once the details are filled in mobile landing page you can select the dealer in the same page &amp; will get the
			thank page directly.
