                                        <li>Spends marginally declined by -5% to €2,144.48 in line with lesser traffic (-7%) and stable cost per click to €0.24, mainly on Tipo and Brand generic campaigns resulted stable impressions (+2%) which affected overall click through rate of the account by -8% to 15.37%.</li>
                                        <li>Conversion volume level up despite lesser traffic on the account from 7 to 8, lowering cost per conversion (€268.06; -17%) and led to improve conversion rate (0.09% vs 0.07%; +22%.</li>
                                        <li>Remarketing users used 32% of the overall traffic share but lead conversion volume went down from 6 to 2, increasing cost per lead and cost per conversion from €131.54 to €418.85.</li>
                                        <li>Channel wise, Desktop acquired maximum conversions 6 vs. 4 last week, while conversions on Mobile remained stable at 2, Tablet (0 vs 1) failed to make any conversion this week.</li>
                                        <li>At model level, Punto is the only model which received 1 conversion. Surprisingly, rest all conversions recorded from Fiat Generic Keywords (7). Due to ending of promotions on Tipo (0 vs. 1) received less traffic and did not convert this week. Even traffic gained on Panda (0 vs. 1) but did not acquire conversion this week.</li>
                                        <li>Traffic increases by +48% on Non-Brand keywords, along with Spends. No conversion recorded on the account this week. Impression share increased (+10%) from 25.24% to 27.68% as visibility lost due to budget increase to 67.66% from 0.01% this week, while impression share lost due to rank declined (-94%) to 4.66% from 74.75%.</li>
                                        <li>Overall impression share declined (-6%) to 47.88% from 50.87% as result of massive increment in loss of impression share due to budget by 12445% from 0.40% to 50.18%. Visibility loss due to low rank declined (-96%) to 1.94% from 48.73%<em>.</em></li>

                                        <br>What are the bullets points an insight should carry?</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>As the reports is having tab names as (weekly, channel, Brand Type, Model, Remarketing) our insights must elaborate on the same lines. Apart from this also include detailed insights for Non-Brand Keywords and Impression share for the account.</li>
                                        <li>Weekly tab describes all the major preforming matrices and their correlations. For e.g CTR = Clicks / Impression, CPC = Cost / Click).</li>
                                        <li>Channel tab mainly focus on devices wise data on account.</li>
                                        <li>In brand tab we mainly focus on brand type. Though we mention Non-brand related keywords in sperate bullet points.</li>
                                        <li>For Model tab we must compare the models only.</li>
                                        <li>Remarketing tab we must mention about only related to remarketing.</li>
                                        <li>And one bullet point for Non-Brand and a separate point for Impression share.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong><u>Points to be remembered:</u></strong></li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>1<sup>st</sup> point</strong>: - In <strong>weekly tab</strong> Carefully observe the main metrics on the and begin with drop or gains – <strong>Spends</strong>, <strong>Traffic</strong> (we must have to mention for which model traffic increases or decrease), <strong>CPC</strong> and <strong>CTR</strong> – trying to find their co-relations.
                                            <br><strong>Note</strong>: - Before we touch down to the rest of the points we must apply <strong>WoW comparison</strong> ((<strong>this week – last week)/last week</strong>) to <strong>all tabs</strong>. This comparison helps to clear the picture about the insights to be noted – whether rise or fall, their percentages, which was the top performing model etc.</li>
                                        <li><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> Point: - </strong>Observe <strong>weekly</strong> tab carefully and focus mainly on <strong>Leads</strong> and <strong>Engagements</strong> whether rise or fall and Because of that what are the parameters affected. The parameter such as (p1-<strong>cost/lead</strong>, p2- <strong>cost/engagements</strong>, p3 – <strong>lead CR</strong>, p4 – <strong>Engagement CR</strong>).</li>
                                        <li><strong>3<sup>rd</sup> point: - Remarketing</strong> always to be begin with, drops or gains in terms <strong>traffic</strong> and <strong>leads</strong> or else what are the sharing percentage from total side by side their relationship with <strong>cost per lead</strong> – percentage as well as in currency.</li>
                                        <li><strong>4<sup>th</sup> point</strong>: - In this point we surely focus on <strong>channels </strong>and mention from highest and lowest performing devices in terms <strong>conversion</strong> (<strong>leads</strong> (always compare to the last week and try to mention in numerical format only) + <strong>engagements</strong> (just mention the how many engagements obtained and the percentile share of engagements from total) compare to the <strong>traffic</strong> variation <strong>with respect to the devices</strong>.</li>
                                        <li><strong>5<sup>th</sup> Point</strong>: - Here in <strong>Model</strong> tab, major focus will be on the highest or lowest performing models with respect to the <strong>traffic</strong> and try to write it down at what cost that we got this amount of leads and <strong>engagements</strong> (<strong>Cost/engagements</strong>, <strong>cost/leads</strong>).and percentile variation of leads and engagements compare to the last week (if need).</li>
                                        <li><strong>6<sup>th</sup> points</strong>: - For this point we must look at <strong>brand type</strong> tab and explains about only Non-brand keywords like what is the status of <strong>traffic</strong> and <strong>CPC </strong>compared to the last week (increasing or else decreasing) and because of that impact on <strong>spends</strong> and most important mention about <strong>leads</strong> and <strong>engagements</strong> at what cost acquire those (if needed <strong>cost/lead</strong>, <strong>cost/engagements</strong>)</li>
                                        <li><strong>7<sup>th</sup> point</strong>: - In Last point we must write about the impression share (<strong>search IS</strong>) and <strong>search</strong> <strong>lost IS budget, Search lost IS rank</strong></li>
                                    </ol>
