            <p>Attached are the Belgium SEM weekly reports and analysis for week: April 16th &ndash; April 22nd, 2018:&nbsp;<strong>(Change date)</strong>&nbsp;<br /><strong>Below is the sample insight for Fiat Brand</strong>&nbsp;(insights for other brands will be in the same format):<br /><br />FIAT</p>
<ul>
<li>Spends note a shift of +5% to &euro; 4,879.09 with +9% increased traffic and slight change in the cost per click -4%. Monthly budget for April was &euro; 21,720.00, out of which 64% has been consumed noting a -9% underspending.</li>
<li>Leads fall from 35 to 31 with loss of leads from Test Drive, which led to +18% rise in cost per lead and proportional loss in the lead rate (-19%).</li>
<li>Model Wise, Leads from Fiat500 and Tipo was unchanged at 7 and 3 respectively. Addition to the leads was seen for Fiat124 Spider (1 to 2). Fresh leads for the week was recorded from Fiat500C (1) and Qubo (1). Leads from Brand keywords marginally fall from 16 to 15.</li>
<li>On contrary to the performance of leads, permissions rise WoW +12% from 1,255 to 1,391 to 1,551 as Find Dealer and Car Configuration grow WoW.</li>
<li>Despite increased traffic for remarketing users, leads slightly drop from 14 to 13 increasing the cost per lead +44%.</li>
<li>Brand search impression share increased to 74% with no loss due to budget but lost due to rank. As well, brand exact match keywords impression share had an 98% coverage.</li>
<li>Change History:
<ul>
<li>Expanded text ad changed: removed, created</li>
<li>Custom Parameter changed</li>
<li>Ad Group paused/enabled</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br /><strong>Points that will help to write insights:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Evaluate the reports &ndash; starting with the leads &gt; relating it to the change in traffic &gt; changes noted in cost per click &gt; how it has affected the Spends and ultimately the cost per lead.</li>
<li>Observe the %change {formula: =(current week value - last week/last week)} and difference in numbers WoW for all the tabs &ndash; brand type wise, remarketing stage and model wise &ndash; as one or more of those might have affected the changes</li>
<li>Point number 2 will roughly give an idea over the model which has affected. To find the root cause - apply comparison with the last week to find the exact campaign.</li>
<li>Check the Graph representation to know the date on which the changes were affected</li>
<li>Change history will help to know the tentative reason that would have affected the changes
<ol type="a ">
<li>Even Google Trends help to know the reason if not supported by Change history</li>
<li>Search term report will give keywords that were out of the campaign focus yet getting clicks and increasing the CPC</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>6. Briefing of insights &ndash;
<ol type="a ">
<li>Starting with the change observed in spends with relation to traffic (clicks) and cost per click. The 1st point will also support the utilization of monthly budget calculated in the &lsquo;Over-Under Spend Calculator_(BE)&rsquo;</li>
<li><strong>2nd Point</strong>&nbsp;will have the changes in leads - effect on CPL &ndash; change in lead rate if required co-relation to traffic also can be mentioned with the performance of the lead generating parameters.</li>
<li><strong>3rd Point</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Model wise changes to be mentioned in terms of leads (always write about the device that recorded highest leads 1st) &ndash; if all models have had conversions; we can mention the ones that affected the most and latter comment for brand generic and non-brand. If no conversions were recorded then change in CTR and CPC affected majorly can be scripted</li>
<li><strong>Next Point</strong>&nbsp;will have the changes in permissions and the performance of the converting parameters.</li>
<li><strong>5th point</strong>&nbsp;is for remarketing users &ndash; the point will be supported highlighting the leads if any in relation to the traffic; if no leads then to comment on the changes in CPC and CTR</li>
<li><strong>Last point</strong>&nbsp;to be jotted for the Impression Share of Brand Campaigns and the effect from the IS lost by budget.</li>
<li><strong>g. And at the End the Change history pointers will be jotted down</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>**As far as possible write the positive points first. While mentioning the change in percentage apply &ndash; or + symbols to define the trend</strong></p>
